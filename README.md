# ESPNTPServer

GPS fueled ESP8266 based NTP Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/liebman/ESPNTPServer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/liebman/ESPNTPServer)

[src](src) Contains the code for the NTP Server

[eagle](eagle) contains the schematic and board designs in Eagle cad.

[enclosure](enclosure) contains the STL files for the enclosure.

This is designed around [this GPS module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075DD5746/) but any module with standard NMEA output and a pult per second signal will work if you redesign the board or use an adapter.

I also used [this display module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O2KDQBE/).  You can use others but be careful with the power polarity, I have modules where VCC and ground pins are in a different order.
